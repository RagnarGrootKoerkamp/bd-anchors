* Minimizer comparison

This repo implements various types of minimizers and compares their density.
See also the [[https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/minimizers/][corresponding blogpost]].

Minimizer types:
- plain minimizers,
- robust minimizers,
- bidirectional anchors ([[https://doi.org/10.1109/tkde.2022.3231780][Loukides, Pissis, and Sweering]]),
- miniception,
- 'robust minimizers' (see blog).



Results for bidirectional anchors:
- For large alphabet (256): density equals $2/(l+1-r)$, and $r=0$ has lowest density for
  $l\leq 40$.
- For small alphabet (4): density is over $2\times$ worse than $2/(l+1-r)$ for
  $r=0$ and $l$ large, and around 10% worse for large $r$.
  The best $r$ increases slowly, roughly linear in $\log_2(l)$:
  - $l\leq 8$: $r=0$
  - $l\leq 15$: $r=1$
  - $l\leq 27$: $r=2$
  - $l\leq 52$: $r=3$
  - $53 \leq l \leq 100$: $r=4$
